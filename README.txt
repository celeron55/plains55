This Luanti mod is a mapgen and a skybox at the same time.

It works with at least Minetest Game.

It does not work with games that set their own skyboxes.

Ideally it would want to display transparent textures, rendered after the skybox, the sun and the moon, but before anything else is rendered. Luanti doesn't have such an API yet AFAIK.
